Gaming  industry  has  witnessed  significant  growth  over  the years. Invention of cathode ray tube in 1940s have deployed the foundation of gaming industry. There was an era of arcade games  and  their  growth  began  in  mid  1960s.  No  sooner  in coming  decades  we  had  8  bits  computer  games  came  in market  since  then  the  growth  of  hardware  for  games  raised year  by  year.  Companies  like  microsoft,  Sega,  Westwood studio  introduced  many  games  like  Solitaire,  Sonic  the Hedgehog,  Dune  etc.  In  min  90s  Sony  releases  very  first PlayStation  and  soon  after  few  years  released  Playstation2 and  became  dominant  in  the  business.  Continuing  in  the business Microsoft took a lead by introducing Xbox 360 with high-definition realism  to  the game market,  as  well  as even better  multiplayer  competitions  on  Xbox  Live  and  popular titles  such  as  Alan  Wake.  In  addition,  Intel  and  Nvidia released Graphic card which led huge business in 3D graphics based  gaming  platforms  and  improved  the  perception  of gaming in the 2000s. The 2010s have completely changed the way  of  playing  games  by  Virtual  reality  and  augmented reality.There  is  a  hype,  that  Internet  of  Things  is  an  independent technology. However, IoT is being enabled by the existence of    other    independent    technologies    which    makes    the fundamental  component  of  IoT. Hardware,  Software,  and Communication   infrastructureare   the   core   fundamental components of IoT.Hardware-Making the physical objects responsive and allows them  to  retreat  the  data  and  respond  to  the  instructions accordingly.Software-Allowing certain operation on data such as store the data, process, manipulate and instructing.Communication  Infrastructure-One  of  the  most  important component that consist of the protocols and technology which enable two physical objects to exchange the data.As the speed of internet is increasing and the cost of computer devices are decreasing, it’s resulting an integration of IoT in the  gaming  industry,  moreover,  the  number  of  free  video games  also  increasing.  There  is  a  considerable  growth  in gaming  community  throughout  the  globe  due  to  production of game development and hardware.Hand  gesture controlling method  is  used to directly  interact with    the    computer    without    any    physical    contact. Implementation  of  this  method  can  be  done  via  Gaming glove, 3D camera, Motion sensor etc. For instance, Kinect, it detects skeleton images of the user and track it’s movement with the help of Depth camera and Motion sensor.Unity is a game engine developed by Unity Technologies, in which  we  can  make  2D  as  well  as  3D  games  for  various platforms.   It   provides   support   for   two   programming languages: C#  and  JavaScript.  Arduino  is  an  open  source hardware and software to interface with different sensors and actuators.  Arduino  provides  an  IDE  in  which  we  can  write programs in C and C++ language and upload them to Arduino board.Input devices generates aninput for the computer and so that computer can process it.Such input devices are used for game controller for example Keyboard,  Mouse,  Joystick,  Touchscreen  etc.  Our  main intention is to design a cost friendly gaming controller for the game. We have developer our own car racing game in Unity 3D.II.PROPOSED SYSTEMWe  will  try  to  construct  a  game  controller  using  MPU 6050(accelerometer) sensor and 4x4 keyboard matrix in this proposed system. We will be able to control the game without any need of keypad or mouse or the idea proposed in existing system.Building the game scene and interfacing sensors.
