abstract: Nowadays, there is a huge inclination of youngsters and adults towards video games and of course in our childhood everyone might definitely have experienced it. However, we are controlling the game using typical input devices such as mouse, keyboard, joystick, etc but how  about,  if  we  control  the  game  using  our  hand  gestures  ?  These  days  we  have  lots  of  game  controllers  that  are  surpassing  the  gaming experience however they are quite expensive too. Through this project we have designed our own game controlling glove using Arduino. In addition we have also developed a car game using UNITY 3D. The areas of IOT and hand gesture recognition will be explored by this project.
